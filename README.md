# Astrology Calendar 

A small ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app that allows users to track and view 2025 astrological events based on their zodiac sign.  
Users select their sign from a dropdown, and the app displays events like Mercury Retrograde, New Moons, and Full Moons with their dates and descriptions.
